							<p>
								Swami Vivekananda Vidyalaya is a major center of Jagriti Bal Vikas Samiti, Kanpur. This school was founded at Lodhar village in 1996. Those days education level was very low in this village. Near about 90% children were deprived from school life. Although there was a primary school in the village but children did not like to go. Children used to graze animals whole day and their guardians’ economic condition was too worse to maintain their livelihood. In this condition, it was only a dream there to provide education in a better school. To convert their dreams into reality Swami Vivekananda Vidyalaya was founded. It tried to bring them in the focus of society by providing them interesting education. Due to Endeavor of teachers and volunteers, children began to take interest in studies and guardians’ attitude changed towards the education. Today 100% girls and boys of Lodhar are getting education. Being impressed by teaching – system of this school students are coming on foot from remote village which are about 5 to 6 km in distance. Swami Vivekananda Vidyalaya is a major centre of Jagriti where it is implementing its ideas on education. This school has classes from KG to VIII, eleven teachers and approximately 320 students. The school has a very good library consisting of approximately 10,000 books. The children and adults from the neighboring villages benefit through this library.

							</header>
							<p>
								During the late eighties Vivekananda Samiti, a student wing of IIT Kanpur along with a few volunteers from outside took up the challenge of educating the children of migrant labourers on the campus. This activity led to a cooperative movement of migrant labourers in 1991. A group consisting of IIT students, faculty, and social workers continued to teach kids of the members of the cooperative. Around 1994 some members of IIT community and social workers felt the necessity of an independent forum to address the issue of education and welfare of underprivileged children. Thus a journey began.
