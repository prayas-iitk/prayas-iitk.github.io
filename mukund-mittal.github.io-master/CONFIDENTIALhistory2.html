								<h2>Prayas: Beginnings</h2>
								<span class="byline">How We Started Our Initiative</span>
							</header>
							<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								Mrs. Vijaya Ramachandran, or Vijaya didi, as she is affectionately known, came to IIT Kanpur in 1968 with her husband, Prof R. Ramachandran of the Physics Department. She resides in the hearts of many people as one of the founders of the Opportunity School and the Karamchari Sangathan in IIT Kanpur and 21 other schools for the kids of migrant laborers in Kanpur. Few people know that she is also the inspiration behind Prayas and had actively fought for workers’ rights on campus while she was here and even fewer people know that she is the daughter of the former President of India, Dr. R. Venkataraman. A few days back, I took a rickshaw to the gate. “Vijaya didi agar yahan par hoti toh sab theek ho jaata” I heard the rickshaw puller say to the cyclist riding beside him. From the back of the rickshaw, I promptly said, “Vijaya Didi?”. I had heard her name several times in Prayas. Before I could say anything more, he said “Aap Vijaya didi ko nahi jaanti? Unhone bahut kuch kiya hai hum logon ke liye.” The Vox team meets her at her present residence in Barasirohi, Kalyanpur. She welcomes us with a broad smile. As we enter her modest apartment, we see a framed photograph of her father and mother on the wall. She fondly remembers the day her father became the President of India, in 1987. In an age of no internet, TV and mobile phones, unaware of the news, she was gardening in the lawn, when reporters and journalists flocked to her Type 4 quarter (in IIT Kanpur), delivering the news. Back in 1970, when she was leaving her house to get her son admitted in the Campus School, her household-helper’s son started crying, saying that he too wanted to go to school. Touched, she wanted to get him admitted as well. However, later, she found out that a few of the faculty members had an objection to servants’ children studying with their children in the same school. These events played a pivotal role in planting the idea of Opportunity School in Vijaya Didi’s mind. Little did she know that the Opportunity School, that was the result of her and Professor CNR Rao’s efforts, would make a remarkable difference to the lives of many, over the years to come. When it was founded, some faculty members contributed a part of their salary every month towards it. The teachers were IIT Kanpur students and faculty members. The Opportunity School is situated behind the Media Centre and is funded by the Alumni Association, contributions of IIT Kanpur employees and a nominal fixed grant from the Institute. It caters to provide education from classes I to VIII to underprivileged children in and around IIT Kanpur.
